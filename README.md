homebrew-facter
=====================

A set of [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) formulae to install [`facter`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter) on macOS.  

Also available is [`libwhereami`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/libwhereami) - but it's not incredibly useful in this context.  

The forumlae are head-only.  

## Usage

    brew tap kmalinich/facter
    brew install --HEAD facter
